Q) Given a string, check if it is a permutation of a palindrome
Definitions

Palindrome: A string that reads the same forward and backward
(e.g., madam, racecar)

Permutation: A rearrangement of characters

👉 The task is not to check if the string itself is a palindrome,
but whether some rearrangement of it can form a palindrome.

Key Observation

For a string to be a palindrome (or a permutation of one):

If the length is even → all characters must have even frequency

If the length is odd → exactly one character can have odd frequency

More than one odd frequency → not possible

Why?

In a palindrome, characters must pair symmetrically around the center

Only one character can sit in the middle (odd count)

Approach (Frequency Array)

Count frequency of each character

Count how many characters have odd frequency

If odd count ≤ 1 → permutation of palindrome exists

code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.nextLine();

        int[] freq = new int[128]; // ASCII characters

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c]++;
        }

        int oddCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
            if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }

        if (oddCount <= 1) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
⏱ Time Complexity
Traversing the string: O(n)
Checking frequency array (fixed size): O(1)
👉 Overall Time Complexity: O(n)

💾 Space Complexity
Frequency array of size 128 (constant)
👉 Space Complexity: O(1)
